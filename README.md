# ImpBot

This bot was created for use in the [Imperian](https://www.imperian.com) Discord Server. Tickets and pull requests are accepted, but are subject to review by the Imperian team. It's unlikely we'll add a large number of features to this bot, but integrations to existing game APIs may be accepted. The notable exception is the Characters API.

## Features

### Polling Imperian APIs

 - This bot polls the News API endpoint to post all new Announce posts in an appropriate channel in Discord
 - This bot polls the Gamefeed API endpoint to post all Gamefeed events in an appropriate channel in Discord

### Vote Reminder
 - The bot will remind server members to vote on TMC every 12 hours (via a DM to anyone that has subscribed)

### Welcome Message

 - A welcome message directing new members to the rules sticky is posted when a new member joins the server

### Commands

 - None, at this time - the bot purely polls Imperian's APIs and posts some information in various Discord channels.
